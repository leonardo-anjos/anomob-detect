# anomob-detect

anomaly detection in mobility data

the analysis is based on the **bus mobility dataset (gps)** from **march 11, 2015**, available at:  
https://dados.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/dataset/dados_mobilidade_onibus_2015_gps_paradas_validacao

these data were made publicly available by **etufor** in partnership with the **fortaleza city hall** through the official open data portal:  
https://dados.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/


## 1. what can be an anomaly?

- very high or negative speed (e.g., > 120 km/h or < 0)  
- zero speed for a long time while the bus is expected to be moving  
- coordinates outside the expected area (e.g., outside the city's geographic boundary)  
- sudden changes in direction or speed that don't make sense (e.g., 180ยบ turn in 1 second)

## 2. steps

### step 1: load and clean the data

- read the csv file  
- handle missing or invalid values

### step 2: basic analysis to find simple anomalies

- detect speeds outside the expected range  
- detect coordinates outside the city's bounding box

### step 3: temporal and spatial analysis

- for each bus, check for sudden jumps in position between consecutive records (using euclidean or haversine distance)  
- identify unusual speed patterns over time

### step 4: machine learning (optional for advanced stages)

- use anomaly detection models, such as:
  - isolation forest  
  - dbscan (for clustering and outlier detection)  
  - neural network autoencoders to detect unusual data patterns
